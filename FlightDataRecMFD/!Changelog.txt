
Special thanks:
    to C3PO for beta testing and design suggestions.
    to Cyrus Phillips for suggesting the G meter implementation.

01-25-2005  Compiled with Orbiter 2005 SDK. (050126)
12-17-2004  Added G meter, column 11.
12-08-2004  Changed RTT unit to km instead of meters to match documentation.
            Fixed first line of data file containing some bogus data.
12-05-2004  Changed AOA unit to degrees instead of radians to match documentation.
11-26-2004  Added user definable data path <SHIFT-H>
            Added user definable data filename <SHIFT-F>
            Added user definable sample rate (Hz) <SHIFT-R> 
            Added auto increment filename toggle <SHIFT-I>
               For auto increment to work, the base filename must include "-0000"
               (without the quotes) before the . and extension.
               For example to use the base file name: "myflightlog" with
               autoincrement turned on use the filename: myflightlog-0000.csv               
               Questions?  email me.
            Added sample rate, delimiter, and auto 
               increment status to MFD display
            MFD now saves data path, filename, 
               sample rate, delimiter character,
               auto increment status, and target
               base to FDRMFD.cfg.  This file is
               located in the config directory of
               the currently running instance of
               orbiter.
            Removed altitude restriction.  
               (sampling will work while landed)
10-25-2004  Initial release for Orbiter build 031217
